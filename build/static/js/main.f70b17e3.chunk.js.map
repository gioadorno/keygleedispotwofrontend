This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.\r\n\r\nThird party links\r\n\r\nOccasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.\r\n\r\nThird Party Services\r\nIn general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.\r\n\r\nHowever, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.\r\n\r\nFor these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.\r\n\r\nIn particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.\r\n\r\nOnce you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nRemarketing\r\n\r\nKeyGlee also may use 3rd party vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including but not limited to the Google Adwords tracking cookie.

These companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, we may use Google’s “remarketing” service to target our ads to you based on your prior use of the Site when you visit on other sites in Google’s content network.\r\n\r\nThis website may use Google AdWords\r\n\r\nThis website uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site.
