Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.\r\n\r\nThird Party Services\r\nIn general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.\r\n\r\nHowever, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.\r\n\r\nFor these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.\r\n\r\nIn particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.\r\n\r\nOnce you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nRemarketing\r\n\r\nKeyGlee also may use 3rd party vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including but not limited to the Google Adwords tracking cookie.
